<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Jack Callister</strong> and I'm a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>. I enjoy building software with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>React JS</strong>.</p>

<p>Checkout out my <a href="http://github.com/jarsbe">Github</a> to see what I build in my spare time. Take a look at my <a href="journal">Journal</a> to see what I learn and share.</p>

<p>I'm available for <strong>freelance</strong> work in early May so get in touch now if you'd like to work together. I also enjoy <strong>collaborating</strong> on the side if that's more your thing.</p>
